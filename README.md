An experimental (work-in-progress) statically typed implementation of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org).

This crate provides methods to automatically generate types to support reading and writing instances of abstract data types in Arrow's in-memory data structures.

## Why

- The [`arrow`](https://docs.rs/arrow) crate provides APIs that make sense when the array types are only known at run-time. Many of its [APIs](https://docs.rs/arrow/latest/arrow/#type-erasure--trait-objects) require the use of [trait objects](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-02-trait-objects.html) and [downcasting](https://docs.rs/arrow/latest/arrow/array/fn.downcast_array.html). However, for applications where types are known at compile-time, these APIs are not ergonomic.
- Builders for [nested](https://docs.rs/arrow/latest/arrow/datatypes/enum.DataType.html#method.is_nested) array types are [complex](https://docs.rs/arrow/latest/arrow/array/struct.StructBuilder.html) and error-prone.

There are [other crates](https://crates.io/search?q=arrow%20derive&sort=relevance) that aim to prevent users from having to maintain array builder code by providing derive macros. These builders typically produce type-erased arrays, whereas this crate only provides fully statically typed arrays.

### Goals and non-goals

#### Goals

- Provide production ready, fully statically typed, safe and efficient Arrow array implementations
- Enable everyone using Rust to easily benefit from the Arrow ecosystem
- Provide zero-copy interop with the [arrow](https://docs.rs/arrow) crate
- Support custom buffer implementations e.g. to support accelerators
- Explore expressing Arrow concepts using the Rust type system, and mapping Rust concepts to Arrow

#### Non-goals

- Support arbitrary array types at runtime (the [arrow](https://docs.rs/arrow) crate supports this use case)
- Provide compute kernels
- Replace other Arrow implementations
